## Exemplary audio samples
---
This page provides audio samples of separation results by the AuxIVA-imp algorithm proposed in the paper 'Improvement of Independent Vector Analysis for Closely Spaced Sources' and its counterpart AuxIVA-ori, i.e., the auxiliary function-based IVA in original form.

These audio samples are obtained in the closely-spaced-source configuration under different reverberations. 

File naming rule: [reverberation time]-[AuxIVA]-[the proposed improved algorithm/ the original algorithm]-[corresponding source ID].wav
