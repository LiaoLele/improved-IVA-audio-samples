# Improvement of independent vector analysis for closely spaced sources

## Exemplary audio samples
---
This page provides audio samples of separation results by the improved algorithms (AuxIVA-imp and ILRMA-imp) proposed in our paper and their counterpart in original forms (AuxIVA-ori and ILRMA-ori) in the closely-spaced-source configuration. The experimental settings are described in Section 4 of this paper.
The naming rule of these audio samples is [reverberation time]-[algorithm]-[corresponding source].wav
